# Linear-and-Ridge-Regression

This program calculates linear and ridge regression for an energy efficiency dataset using matrices. To evaluate the quality of each regression, it also calculates the loss function, mean sum squared error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute error. The dataset is limited to 8 features and 2 targets, but this program is developed to handle more features and targets.

## Requirements
* Python 3.12
* GNU Make
* Packages listed in requirements.txt
* Energy effeciency data set named "ENB2012_data.xlsx" in the repository

## Instructions
1. Install Python 3.12 and Make
2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShemDeLeon/Linear-and-Ridge-Regression.git
```
3. Enter the directory
```bash
cd Linear-and-Ridge-Regression
```
4. Run the Makefile
```bash
make
```
